# Visualize Hurst Exponents

This notebook allows for interactive visualization of time-series generated
according to different Hurst exponents.

## Using Notebook
This assumes that you have a python 3.x installation.

### Clone Repository
``` git clone git@github.com:wsavran/hurst_visualizer.git ```

### Install Dependencies for Python 3.x
I do this from the top-level directory of the repository.

``` virtualenv venv ```

``` source venv/bin/activate```

```python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip```

```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```


### Run Notebook
``` jupyter notebook```

This should automatically open your browser and allow you to select the notebook to interact with. Enjoy the colored noises. Make sure to run all cells.

``` Cell -> Run All ```

### Deactivate Virtualenv
When you are done looking at Hurst exponents...

``` deactivate ```
