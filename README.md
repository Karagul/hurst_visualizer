# Visualize Hurst Exponents

This notebook allows for interactive visualization of time-series generated
according to different Hurst exponents. 

The general form of the power-spectrum is a power-law where the Hurst exponent
is related to the power-law exponent through B = 2H + 1; where B is the
power-law exponent and H is the hurst exponent.
